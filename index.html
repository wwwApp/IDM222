                    Hi, I'm Woo, an UI Desginer based in Philadelphia, PA.<br>
                    I'm currently studying at Drexel University to bring you the best experience out of your devices!

                            The Zodiac Project invites you to the festival of Chinese Zodiac!
                            Clicking on each lamp will let you know what each animal symoblizes
                            and which zodiac animal you are based on your birthday.
                            My focus was to bring an uniqe and engaging interface to support the site's functionality.

                            My job in this project was to re-design SparkNote in a way that it brings the
                            most appropriate and the quickest result for users' goals from the site.
                            I focused on organizing the contents in the main page to allow users to access
                            what they want at their first glance, and supporting secondary study guide within the study guide page;
                            this will help reducing the number of page-switching/tab-switching within one page.

                            My frist project in Web Design.
                            CSMG is the mortgage company located in Blue Bell, PA.
                            The color combination of Green and Gold helps setting the company's identity
                            as a business involving assets.

                            It was my first try coming up with an idea and a design for mobile application.
                            I came up with the idea from the experiences of myself setting up multiple alarms
                            for everyday's tasks.
                            Alarmdar is an application that will allows you to pick your events from your
                            desired calendar or event-schedulers and automatically sets multiple alarms 
                            based on the various options you can choose - your location from destination, transporation, etc.

                            I used the photo of cabbage and myself to portrait myself with cabbage head in the Illustration.
                            To present myself as an alien villain invaiding an Earth,
                            I made use of the colors that will alert the viewers of dangers along with the rough textures
                            of the main logo.
